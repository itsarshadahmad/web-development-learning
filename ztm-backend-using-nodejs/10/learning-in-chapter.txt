Test using Jest:- 

Jest doesn't work great with mongoose so we require to configure jest by
jest.config.js file or package.json to set jest as testEnvironment to node.
It keeps creating trouble to use mongoose and jest together so better to use
documentation for guide.

Testing also create problem if your mongodb server code is inside server.js 
because test starts from app.js so keep mongodb server code in seperate 
mongo.js file to keep it orgainized and if require can call multiple times
which will be inside test file to connect and disconnect server.



Mongodb:-

Mongodb is used with mongoose to have concrete model based on schema which
we create using mongoose which mongodb driver doesn't allows us.
Model is convinient way to work with db which sql has but mongodb doesn't
so mongoose helps their to achieve that. Mongodb also can't link or refer or
in sql can join other collections or db which mongoose helps us to do in 
rough way using ref tag or refer item in schema to link or refer to that part.

Mongoose talk to mongodb driver to create any collection in db or item to 
perform operation on. It is ODM or object (document) mapper. Mongodb store 
data in form of bson.

It is better to create model and schema of mongoose in seperate file so it
can exported to everyone that can use to perform crud operations.
ex:- launches.mongo.js

Mongoose.connection has event which we can listen to handle certain condition
like error, data, etc.

__v is created by mongoose to follow set of mongoose model versions. by
default version is set to 0. You can make few data work on previous model ex-
old stored data but can change version to __v: 1 to add new details or changes
in model of mogoose.

_id is objectId which is used to store uniquely identify items of any 
collection and _id can be used to get time stamp because internally mongodb
it uses timestamp and abstacted code create unqiue item in your collection 
mongodb.
